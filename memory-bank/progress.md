## Current Status

### Development Phase
- **Current**: Sprint S01 Implementation In Progress
- **Next Step**: T03 - Workflow State Machine
- **Completed**: T00 Foundation Setup, T01 Orchestrator Service Structure, T02 Session Management
- **Blocker**: Critical security issues in session management need immediate fixes
- **Hours Spent**: 10 hours (T00: 2 hours, T01: 4 hours, T02: 4 hours)
- **Hours Remaining**: 68 hours (Sprint S01)

### Technical Readiness
- Architecture: ✅ Fully designed
- Specifications: ✅ ADRs complete
- Task Breakdown: ✅ Sprint planned
- Environment: ✅ Docker services running
- Dependencies: ✅ All installed and verified

### Team Status
- Planning: Complete
- Development: Active (T00, T01, T02 complete)
- Testing: Strong coverage (Orchestrator: 97.6%, Session: 87%)
- Documentation: Foundation complete, godoc comments added, session docs created

## Known Issues
1. **Port Conflict**: PostgreSQL default port 5432 was already in use, changed to 5433
2. **Dependency Management**: MCP and ChromaDB Go clients not yet added to go.mod (will be added during integration tasks)
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: 
   - SQL injection in session List() method - CRITICAL
   - SessionNote field not persisted (db:"-" tag) - HIGH
   - Memory leak risk from unbounded cache - MEDIUM
   - Race condition from storing pointers in cache - MEDIUM

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
1. **Go + MCP**: Chosen for performance and official library support
2. **PostgreSQL**: Proven reliability for persistent storage
3. **ChromaDB**: Leading vector database for semantic search
4. **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable and testable design

### Planning Refinements
1. **Added Security Focus**: Rate limiting and audit logging elevated to Sprint 1
2. **ChromaDB Early**: Vector storage moved from future to Sprint 1
3. **MCP Compliance**: Error format alignment added to tasks
4. **Parallel Processing**: Emphasized throughout for performance

### Architecture Evolution
1. **Service Layer**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Middleware Pattern**: Cross-cutting concerns handled elegantly
3. **Repository Pattern**: Database abstraction for testing
4. **State Machine**: Workflow complexity managed effectively

### Process Learnings
1. **ADRs Valuable**: Clear specifications prevent ambiguity
2. **Compliance Reviews**: Catch gaps before implementation
3. **Task Granularity**: 4-12 hour tasks optimal
4. **Parallel Agents**: Significant planning efficiency gain
5. **Test-First Development**: Writing tests alongside code prevents coverage debt
6. **Code Review Integration**: zen:codereview catches issues before completion
7. **Error Patterns**: Sentinel errors better than string matching
8. **Session Management**:
   - UUID generation provides security and uniqueness
   - Optimistic locking prevents update conflicts
   - Background workers need graceful shutdown
   - Security review critical - found SQL injection vulnerability
   - Cache design must consider memory bounds from start

## Metrics and Milestones

### Planning Metrics
- ADRs Created: 7
- Tasks Defined: 12
- Hours Estimated: 78
- Compliance: 95%

### Target Metrics
- Test Coverage: >70%
- Response Time: <1s
- Token Limit: 25,000
- Rate Limit: 100 req/min

### Upcoming Milestones
1. **Week 1**: Complete Sprint S01 (Foundation)
2. **Week 2**: Complete Sprint S02 (MCP Protocol)
3. **Week 3**: Complete Sprint S03 (Integration)
4. **Week 4**: M01 Demo and Review

## Risk Register
1. **Token Limit Complexity**: May require sophisticated summarization
2. **ChromaDB Performance**: Unknown at scale
3. **Memory Evolution**: Algorithm complexity high
4. **MCP Compliance**: Strict format requirements

## Next Actions
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix SQL injection vulnerability in session List() method
2. **IMMEDIATE**: Remove db:"-" tag from SessionNote struct
3. **URGENT**: Implement cache size limits (LRU or max size)
4. **URGENT**: Fix race condition by storing session copies in cache
5. Begin T03: Workflow State Machine implementation
6. Build on session foundation for state transitions
