- Development: Not started
- Testing: Not started
- Documentation: Foundation complete

## Known Issues
None yet - project in planning phase.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
1. **Go + MCP**: Chosen for performance and official library support
2. **PostgreSQL**: Proven reliability for persistent storage
3. **ChromaDB**: Leading vector database for semantic search
4. **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable and testable design

### Planning Refinements
1. **Added Security Focus**: Rate limiting and audit logging elevated to Sprint 1
2. **ChromaDB Early**: Vector storage moved from future to Sprint 1
3. **MCP Compliance**: Error format alignment added to tasks
4. **Parallel Processing**: Emphasized throughout for performance

### Architecture Evolution
1. **Service Layer**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Middleware Pattern**: Cross-cutting concerns handled elegantly
3. **Repository Pattern**: Database abstraction for testing
4. **State Machine**: Workflow complexity managed effectively

### Process Learnings
1. **ADRs Valuable**: Clear specifications prevent ambiguity
2. **Compliance Reviews**: Catch gaps before implementation
3. **Task Granularity**: 4-12 hour tasks optimal
4. **Parallel Agents**: Significant planning efficiency gain

## Metrics and Milestones

### Planning Metrics
- ADRs Created: 7
- Tasks Defined: 12
- Hours Estimated: 78
- Compliance: 95%

### Target Metrics
- Test Coverage: >70%
- Response Time: <1s
- Token Limit: 25,000
- Rate Limit: 100 req/min

### Upcoming Milestones
1. **Week 1**: Complete Sprint S01 (Foundation)
2. **Week 2**: Complete Sprint S02 (MCP Protocol)
3. **Week 3**: Complete Sprint S03 (Integration)
4. **Week 4**: M01 Demo and Review

## Risk Register
1. **Token Limit Complexity**: May require sophisticated summarization
2. **ChromaDB Performance**: Unknown at scale
3. **Memory Evolution**: Algorithm complexity high
4. **MCP Compliance**: Strict format requirements

## Next Actions
1. Initialize Go module and project structure
2. Set up PostgreSQL and ChromaDB
3. Configure development environment
4. Begin T01: Orchestrator Service Structure
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
