ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS
ABSOLUTE RULE: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: START UP PROTOCOL
BRING THE FOLLOWING AGENTS ONLINE:
1. general-purpose
2. project-chronicle-keeper
3. todo-completion-tracker
4. debug-specialist
5. task-breakdown-manager
6. code-review-expert
7. protocol-compliance-guardian
8. technical-docs-writer

## Quick Reference
- **Start of task**: Read memory bank â†’ Plan with TodoWrite
- **During work**: Navigate with Serena â†’ Debug with Zen
- **End of task**: Update memory â†’ Write to Serena â†’ Update .claude-updates
- **Always**: Test with `go test ./...` â†’ Format with `gofmt`

### Development Rules

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS follow Go best practices ( see `go_best_practices.md`) when writing Go code.
- When using third party libraries, use `go doc` to read the documentation and understand how to use the library correctly.
- NEVER write custom implementations if the library provides the functionality you need.
- ALWAYS use Zen MCP commands to debug, analyse and review the code. If facing a problem or failing tests, use `zen:debug` to understand the problem.
- ALWAYS use Serena MCP commands to traverse the codebase and find relevant files and information.
- If in doubt, ask the user for help or clarification.

### When to Use Subagents
Launch parallel subagents using the Task tool when:
- Searching for code across multiple files (use Agent tool)
- Performing multiple independent analyses
- Updating different documentation files simultaneously
- Running multiple test suites or checks
  Example: When updating memory bank, launch 8 agents to update each file in parallel

    - Update activeContext.md with current work status
    - Update progress.md if milestones were reached
    - Update other files only if their content changed
2. **Write Serena Memory**:
    - Create a memory file named: `[Task]_[Date].md`
    - Include: what was done, key decisions, learnings
3. **Update .claude-updates**:
    - Review (Log Update Management)[#log-update-management] for explicit instructions to be followed
    - Run: `date '+%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S %p'` for timestamp
    - APPEND one-line entry with: timestamp, what changed, why, files modified

### Tool Usage Guidelines
- **For Code Navigation**: Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` or
  `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern`
- **For Debugging**: Use `mcp__zen__debug` for systematic investigation
- **For Code Review**: Use `mcp__zen__codereview` before finalizing changes
- **For Memory Writing**: Use `mcp__serena__write_memory` for persistent notes

### Error Recovery Protocol
When encountering errors:
1. **Build Errors**: Use `mcp__zen__debug` to investigate
2. **Test Failures**: Analyze with table-driven test patterns
3. **Memory Conflicts**: Check .serena/memories/ for existing entries
4. **Tool Failures**: Fall back to manual methods and notify user

Always document the error and solution in .claude-updates

# Claude Code's Memory Bank

I am Claude Code, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation.

After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively.

At the start of EVERY new conversation or task I MUST:
1. First, read all 6 core memory bank files in order:
    - projectbrief.md â†’ productContext.md â†’ activeContext.md
    - systemPatterns.md â†’ techContext.md â†’ progress.md
2. Check for any additional context files in memory-bank/
3. Only proceed with the task after understanding current state

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
    - Foundation document that shapes all other files
    - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
    - Defines core requirements and goals
    - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
    - Why this project exists
    - Problems it solves
    - How it should work
    - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
    - Current work focus
    - Recent changes
    - Next steps
    - Active decisions and considerations
    - Important patterns and preferences
    - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
    - System architecture
    - Key technical decisions
    - Design patterns in use
    - Component relationships
    - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
    - Technologies used
    - Development setup
    - Technical constraints
    - Dependencies
    - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
    - What works
    - What's left to build
    - Current status
    - Known issues
    - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Documentation Updates

### Memory Bank Update Triggers
Update memory bank files when:
1. **Major Feature Completed**: Update progress.md and activeContext.md
2. **Architecture Changed**: Update systemPatterns.md
3. **New Dependencies Added**: Update techContext.md
4. **Task Priorities Changed**: Update activeContext.md
5. **User Explicitly Requests**: Review and update ALL files
6. **End of Development Session**: At minimum, update activeContext.md

        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

### Common Scenario Examples

#### Starting a New Task:
1. Read all memory bank files
2. Use TodoWrite and `mcp__zen__planner` to plan steps
3. Search for relevant code with Serena
4. Implement changes
5. Run tests and debug with Zen
6. Update documentation

#### Debugging a Test Failure:
1. Use `mcp__zen__debug` with the error details
2. Follow investigation steps provided
3. Fix the issue
4. Verify with `go test -race ./...`
5. Document fix in .claude-updates

### Go Development Checklist
Before considering any Go code complete:
- [ ] Run `gofmt -s -w .` to format code
- [ ] Run `go test ./...` to verify all tests pass
- [ ] Run `go test -race ./...` to check for race conditions
- [ ] Run `go build ./...` to ensure compilation
- [ ] Check coverage with `go test -cover ./...`
- [ ] Use Zen tools if any tests fail
- [ ] Review code with `zen:codereview`


## Log Update Management
This set of guidelines covers how to properly manage the .claude-updates file and maintain project documentation. These rules are specific to the Culture Curious project workflow and ensure proper tracking of development changes.

## Update file management
- IMPORTANT: ALWAYS APPEND a new entry with the current timestamp and a summary of the change.
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT overwrite existing entries in .claude-updates.
- Follow the simple chronological format: `- DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS [am/pm] - [concise description]`
- ALWAYS use bash date format: `date '+%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S %p'` to get precise date and time.
- Use a single line entry that captures the essential change, reason, and key files modified
- Include testing verification and technical details in a concise manner
- Avoid multi-section detailed formats - keep entries scannable and brief
- Focus on what was changed, why it was changed, and verification steps in one clear sentence

## Documentation workflow
- Always update .claude-updates at the end of every development session
- Include root cause analysis when fixing bugs or issues
- Document both the problem and the solution implemented
- Reference specific files that were modified
- Include verification steps taken to confirm the fix

## Development verification process
- Always restart the server after making changes to templates, CSS, or Go code
- Run tests with `go test ./...` before considering work complete
- Build the project with `go build ./...` to ensure no compilation errors
- Use browser testing to verify UI changes are working as expected
- Take screenshots when fixing visual issues to document before/after states

## Communication style
- Provide clear explanations of root causes when debugging issues
- Include specific technical details about what was changed
- Document the reasoning behind implementation choices
- Be thorough in explaining both the problem and solution
