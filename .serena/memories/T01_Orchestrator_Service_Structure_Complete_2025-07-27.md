# T01 Orchestrator Service Structure - Completion Report

## Task Overview
- **Task ID**: T01_S01
- **Title**: Orchestrator Service Structure
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Date**: 2025-07-27
- **Test Coverage**: 97.6% (orchestrator package)

## What Was Done
1. **Created Complete Package Structure**
   - `/internal/orchestrator/` with all required subpackages
   - session, workflow, todolist, services, errors packages
   - Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns

2. **Implemented Core Components**
   - Orchestrator interface with all required methods
   - Thread-safe dependency injection container
   - Comprehensive configuration management
   - All subsystem interfaces and basic implementations

3. **Achieved High Test Coverage**
   - Started at 16.9% (failed initial code review)
   - Implemented comprehensive table-driven tests
   - Achieved 97.6% coverage for orchestrator package
   - 100% coverage for errors, session, todolist, workflow packages

## Key Decisions
1. **Error Handling**: Implemented sentinel errors pattern instead of string matching
2. **Session Updates**: Consolidated multiple updates into single operation
3. **Configuration**: Fixed mutation issues and removed hardcoded passwords
4. **Thread Safety**: Ensured container operations are properly synchronized

## Lessons Learned
1. **Test Coverage Critical**: Must write tests alongside implementation, not after
2. **Code Review Value**: zen:codereview caught important issues before completion
3. **Error Patterns**: Sentinel errors with errors.Is() superior to string matching
4. **Table-Driven Tests**: Efficient way to achieve high coverage in Go

## Technical Notes
- MCP and ChromaDB dependencies not yet in go.mod (deferred to integration tasks)
- Services package has 0% coverage (acceptable for interfaces-only package)
- All public APIs have complete godoc documentation

## Next Steps
- T02: Session Management Implementation (persistent storage with PostgreSQL)
- Build on the solid foundation established in T01
