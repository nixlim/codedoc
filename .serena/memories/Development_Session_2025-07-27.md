# Development Session - July 27, 2025

## Session Summary
Completed comprehensive memory synchronization across all project memory systems after T00 Foundation Setup completion.

## What Was Done
1. **Memory Bank Updates**
   - Updated activeContext.md with latest status and memory sync completion
   - Updated progress.md with hours tracking (2/78 hours completed)
   - All 6 core files reviewed and confirmed accurate

2. **TodoWrite System**
   - Created complete task list with all 12 Sprint S01 tasks
   - Set proper priorities: High (T01-T05, T11-T12), Medium (T06-T08), Low (T09-T10)
   - T00 marked as completed, all others pending

3. **ZetMem Semantic Storage**
   - Workspace confirmed with 3 initial memories
   - Added 2 new memories: Development Status and Architecture Insights
   - Total 5 semantic memories for AI-powered search

4. **Project State Verification**
   - Docker services running (PostgreSQL:5433, ChromaDB:8000)
   - Go dependencies installed and verified
   - Project structure follows clean architecture
   - All configuration files in place

## Key Decisions
- Maintain PostgreSQL on port 5433 to avoid conflicts
- Use amikos-tech/chroma-go v0.2.3 for ChromaDB integration
- Follow clean architecture with strict layer separation
- Implement security features early (T11) rather than later

## Next Actions
1. Begin T01: Orchestrator Service Structure (4 hours)
2. Define core interfaces and types
3. Set up dependency injection with Wire
4. Create orchestrator container structure

## Technical Context
- Go 1.24+ with mark3labs/mcp-go v0.5.0
- PostgreSQL 15 and ChromaDB latest
- Clean Architecture with 4 main layers
- Repository pattern for data abstraction
- Service layer for business logic
