# CodeDoc MCP Server - Project Status
Date: 2025-07-27

## Current State
- **Sprint**: S01 - Foundation and Orchestrator Core
- **Status**: Implementation in progress
- **Completed**: T00 Foundation Setup (2 hours)
- **Remaining**: 11 tasks, 78 hours

## Recent Activities
1. **Foundation Setup Completed**:
   - Go module initialized as github.com/nixlim/codedoc-mcp-server
   - All dependencies installed including ChromaDB Go client
   - PostgreSQL configured on port 5433 (avoiding conflict)
   - Docker services running (PostgreSQL + ChromaDB)
   - Database migrations created
   - Basic build verified

2. **Project Structure Established**:
   - Clean architecture with clear separation
   - `/internal` for private packages
   - `/pkg` for public packages
   - `/cmd/server` for main application
   - Comprehensive ADRs in `/docs`

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Go 1.24+** with mark3labs/mcp-go library
- **PostgreSQL 15** on port 5433
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage
- **Clean Architecture** with DI using wire
- **Table-driven tests** for quality assurance

## Next Steps
1. Start T01: Orchestrator Service Structure (4 hours)
2. Create core interfaces and types
3. Implement dependency injection setup
4. Continue through Sprint S01 tasks

## Important Learnings
- Port conflicts require configuration adjustment
- ChromaDB integration requires embedder abstraction
- Security measures (rate limiting, audit logging) elevated to Sprint 1
- Compliance review caught critical missing features
