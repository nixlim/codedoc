## Sprint S01: Foundation and Orchestrator Core
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Focus**: Build the orchestration infrastructure

### Key Deliverables:
- Session management with UUID tracking
- Workflow state machine implementation
- TODO list creation and tracking
- Database schema and repositories
- Inter-service communication interfaces

### Critical Path:
1. Session Manager (T02) - blocks all workflow operations
2. State Machine (T03) - required for orchestration logic
3. Database Schema (T05) - needed for persistence

## Sprint S02: MCP Protocol Implementation
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Focus**: Implement all MCP tools with token awareness

### Key Deliverables:
- All 8 MCP tool handlers functional
- Token counting within 1% accuracy
- Callback session management
- Structured error responses
- Integration with orchestrator

### Critical Path:
1. Token Counting (T12) - blocks all MCP operations
2. Core Tools (T13/T14) - main functionality
3. Callback Tools (T15) - enables AI interaction

## Sprint S03: File System Service and Integration
**Duration**: 1.5 weeks  
**Focus**: Security, performance, and full integration

### Key Deliverables:
- Secure file system operations
- Path validation with 100% coverage
- Performance optimization (<100ms SLA)
- Complete service integration
- End-to-end workflow testing

### Critical Path:
1. Path Validation (T22) - security critical
2. Service Integration (T25) - milestone completion
3. Performance Optimization (T26) - SLA compliance

## Resource Allocation

### Sprint S01 (64 hours)
- High Priority: 38 hours (59%)
- Medium Priority: 14 hours (22%)
- Low Priority: 12 hours (19%)

### Sprint S02 (68 hours)
- High Priority: 44 hours (65%)
- Medium Priority: 18 hours (26%)
- Low Priority: 14 hours (21%)

### Sprint S03 (82 hours)
- High Priority: 46 hours (56%)
- Medium Priority: 22 hours (27%)
- Low Priority: 14 hours (17%)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks:
1. **MCP Protocol Complexity** (S02)
   - Mitigation: Early prototyping, study examples
   
2. **Path Traversal Security** (S03)
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite, security audit

3. **Token Counting Accuracy** (S02)
   - Mitigation: Multiple validation strategies

### Schedule Risks:
- S03 has 1.5 week duration - monitor closely
- Integration complexity may require buffer time

## Success Metrics

### Sprint S01:
- [ ] State machine handles all transitions
- [ ] Session CRUD operations < 10ms
- [ ] 80% unit test coverage

### Sprint S02:
- [ ] All 8 MCP tools return valid responses
- [ ] Token counting 99% accurate
- [ ] < 200ms response time

### Sprint S03:
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] < 100ms file operations
- [ ] End-to-end workflow completes

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups
- Focus on blockers and dependencies
- Track critical path progress
- Identify integration issues early

### Sprint Reviews
- S01: Demo orchestrator functionality
- S02: Show all MCP tools working
- S03: Complete workflow demonstration

### Stakeholder Updates
- Weekly progress against Definition of Done
- Risk status and mitigation actions
- Performance metrics and benchmarks

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Review and refine sprint plans
   - Set up development environment
   - Complete foundation milestone if needed

2. **Sprint S01 Kickoff**:
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set up daily standup schedule
   - Create development branches

3. **Preparation**:
   - Study mark3labs/mcp-go examples
   - Review security best practices
   - Set up monitoring infrastructure

## Notes
- Each sprint builds on the previous one
- Focus on quality over speed
- Security and performance are non-negotiable
- Document decisions and learnings
