# Sprint S03: File System Service and Integration

## Sprint Goal
Implement secure file system operations with comprehensive path validation, integrate all services together, and ensure the complete documentation workflow functions end-to-end with proper performance and security.

## Sprint Backlog

### High Priority Tasks

#### T21: File System Service Core
- Create `/internal/service/filesystem/` package
- Implement `FileSystemService` interface
- Add dependency injection setup
- **Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Acceptance**: Service structure ready for implementation

#### T22: Path Validation Security
- Implement comprehensive path validation
- Use filepath.Clean and custom validators
- Add workspace isolation enforcement
- Create path traversal attack tests
- **Estimate**: 10 hours
- **Acceptance**: 100% security test coverage, no vulnerabilities

#### T23: File Traversal Implementation
- Implement efficient recursive traversal
- Add .gitignore pattern support
- Create file type detection system
- Handle symbolic links safely
- **Estimate**: 12 hours
- **Acceptance**: Can traverse 10K+ files efficiently

#### T24: Caching Layer
- Implement multi-level cache strategy
- Add LRU cache for hot paths
- Create cache invalidation logic
- Add metrics for cache performance
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: Cache hit rate >80% for repeated operations

#### T25: Service Integration
- Wire all services together
- Implement full documentation workflow
- Add end-to-end error handling
- Create integration test suite
- **Estimate**: 12 hours
- **Acceptance**: Complete workflow executes successfully

### Medium Priority Tasks

#### T26: Performance Optimization
- Implement concurrent file operations
- Add streaming for large directories
- Optimize memory usage
- Create performance benchmarks
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: <100ms for file operations

#### T27: Monitoring and Metrics
- Add Prometheus metrics for all operations
- Create performance dashboards
- Implement SLA tracking
- Add alerting for violations
- **Estimate**: 6 hours
- **Acceptance**: All operations have metrics

#### T28: Security Hardening
- Implement rate limiting per workspace
- Add audit logging for all access
- Create security event monitoring
- Add penetration test suite
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: Passes security audit

### Low Priority Tasks

#### T29: Advanced Features
- Add file content sampling
- Implement smart file grouping
- Create language detection
- Add binary file handling
- **Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Acceptance**: Features work without impacting core performance

#### T30: Documentation and Deployment
- Complete API documentation
- Create deployment guide
- Write performance tuning guide
- Add troubleshooting documentation
- **Estimate**: 6 hours
- **Acceptance**: Documentation complete and accurate

## Definition of Done
- [ ] File system operations secure against all known attacks
- [ ] Performance meets <100ms SLA for all operations
- [ ] All services integrated and working together
- [ ] End-to-end documentation workflow tested
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] All integration tests passing

## Dependencies
- Sprints S01 and S02 complete
- All services ready for integration
- Security requirements understood

## Risks
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Path traversal is critical
- **Performance at scale**: Large codebases may stress system
- **Integration complexity**: Multiple services must coordinate

## Technical Decisions
- Use OS-specific file APIs for performance
- Implement defense-in-depth for security
- Cache aggressively but invalidate smartly
- Use goroutines for parallel operations

## Performance Targets
- File listing: <50ms for 1000 files
- Tree traversal: <1s for 10,000 files
- Cache operations: <1ms
- Path validation: <0.1ms

## Security Checklist
- [ ] Path validation prevents traversal
- [ ] Symbolic links handled safely
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Audit logging complete
- [ ] No information disclosure
- [ ] Resource limits enforced

## Sprint Demo Scenarios
1. Demonstrate secure file operations
2. Show performance with large codebase
3. Walk through complete documentation flow
4. Demonstrate error handling and recovery
5. Show monitoring dashboards

## Notes
This sprint completes the Core Services milestone. The focus is on security, performance, and reliability. We're building the foundation that all future features will depend on, so quality is paramount.

## Daily Standup Questions
1. What security measures did you implement?
2. How is performance looking?
3. Any integration issues discovered?
4. Are we meeting our SLAs?

## Sprint Review Agenda
1. Security demonstration and audit results
2. Performance benchmarks presentation
3. End-to-end workflow demonstration
4. Monitoring and metrics review
5. Milestone completion assessment
6. Plan for next milestone (AI Integration)
